# Assignment 5 - Loop Challenges

## Challenge 1 — Sum & Average
- Loop type: **for loop**
- Why: We know the exact set of numbers, so a for loop is natural.
- How: Loop through the list, add each number to a running total, then compute average.

## Challenge 2 — Find Maximum
- Loop type: **for loop**
- Why: To check every number one by one against the current maximum.
- How: Start with first number, loop through the rest, update maximum when a bigger number is found.

## Challenge 3 — Multiplication Table Grid
- Loop type: **nested for loops**
- Why: A multiplication table is a grid (2D). One loop prints rows, the inner loop prints columns.
- How: Print header row, then for each row loop, multiply row × column and print with spacing.

## AI Usage
- AI was used to **clarify loop formatting and alignment ideas**.
- The core loop logic (choosing `for` loops and nesting) was written and understood by me.
